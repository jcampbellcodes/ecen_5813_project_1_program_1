# PES Project 1 Readme

## Contributors: Troy Davis, Jack Campbell

## Organization:
Each program is organized by a subdirectory containing a CMake config and include/source dirs.
To build and run the programs using Makefiles, navigate to the root directory and run these commands. This requires CMake 3.14 installed.
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./program_1/ecen_5813_project_1_program_1
./program_1/ecen_5813_project_1_program_2
./program_1/ecen_5813_project_1_program_3
```
